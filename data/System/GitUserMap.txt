---+!! !FoswikiOrg Plugin: Git User Mapping

This topic implements an optional mapping of github account information to the
WikiName of the committer/author.  When a "push" event occurs, the github
account information is included in the push information

---++ Identifying Information

Two or three fields are provided on each push:

   $ *"name"*: The name provided on the github user account. Typically this provide as "First Last", although older github accounts might use this as the username (see below),
   $ *"email"*: The email address registered on the github user account.,
   $ *"username"*: The github account userid.

The information is provided in two blocks within the push.  ="Author"= and ="Committer"=.  The author information represents the original author of the commit.  This is
obtained from information like a pull request.  The committer is the user who pushes the commit to the github repository.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%T% Do not edit this topic directly. Copy it into your %USERSWEB% web, or to the web.topic identified in the configuration to activate it. *This topic can expose private / personal email addresses. It should be view restricted to the Main.AdminGroup or other trusted group*.</div> <verbatim>
      "author": {
        "name": "joe",
        "email": "joe@foswiki.com",
        "username": "joe123"
      },
      "committer": {
        "name": "Weblate",
        "email": "weblate@foswiki.org",
      },</verbatim>

---++ Mapping Table

Fill in the name, email and username of the github account, along with the WikiName that
should be attributed for the checkins in the Tasks web.
When a push is receved,  the Author name, email and username, then Committer name, email and username are checked for a match in
this table. The *exact match* will be used to assign the wikiname.

To map an entry when the github push is missing an entry, create a mapping
entry using the string 'undef' in place of the =name=, =email= and/or =username=
fields.

<div class="foswikiHelp">Be sure this table saves as a TML table. Any line in
this topic beginning with vertical bar will be considered as a table entry
</div>

The following example push would match the "author" in the above example and assign the commit
to !TheAuthor.  The 2nd line would match the committer, however the committer
is only examined if the author field cannot be resolved.

| *name* | *email* | *username* | *WikiName* |
| joe | joe@foswiki.com | joe123 | TheAuthor |
| Weblate | weblate@foswiki.org | undef | WikiTranslationGnome |
