---+!! !FoswikiOrg Plugin: Git User Mapping

This topic implements an optional mapping of github account information to the
WikiName of the committer/author.  When a "push" event occurs, the github
account information is included in the push information

---++ Identifying Information

Two or three fields are provided on each push:

   $ *"name"*: The name provided on the github user account. Typically this provide as "First Last", although older github accounts might use this as the username (see below),
   $ *"email"*: The email address registered on the github user account.,
   $ *"username"*: The github account userid.

The information is provided in two blocks within the push.  ="Author"= and ="Committer"=.  The author information represents the original author of the commit.  This is
obtained from information like a pull request.  The committer is the user who pushes the commit to the github repository.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%T% Do not edit this topic directly. Copy it into your %USERSWEB% web, or to the web.topic identified in the configuration to activate it. *This topic can expose private / personal email addresses. It should be view restricted to the Main.AdminGroup or other trusted group*.</div> <verbatim>
      "author": {
        "name": "joe",
        "email": "joe@foswiki.com",
        "username": "joe123"
      },
      "committer": {
        "name": "joe",
        "email": "joe@foswiki.com",
        "username": "joe123"
      },</verbatim>

---++ Mapping Table

Fill in the name, email and username of the github account, along with the WikiName that
should be attributed for the checkins in the Tasks web.
When a push is receved,  the Author name, email and username, then Committer name, email and username are checked for a match in
this table. The *exact match* will be used to assign the wikiname.

<div class="foswikiHelp">Be sure this table saves as a TML table. Any line in
this topic beginning with vertical bar will be considered as a table entry
</div>

The following example push would match the "committer" in the above example and assign the commit
to !TheAuthor.

| *name* | *email* | *username* | *WikiName* |
| joe | joe@foswiki.com | joe123 | TheAuthor |
